## 13. POKT Network Foundation (PNF)

13.1 The PNF Articles enshrine the Foundation’s role as steward to the POKT Network ecosystem and the Foundation’s accountability to the POKT DAO.

13.2 The Foundation shall serve as a custodial entity for POKT Network, deferring decision-making to the POKT DAO in all cases except Material Adverse Exception Events (MAEEs), i.e. crises resulting from incomplete contracts and unforeseen events.

13.3 MAEEs may include:

  * the POKT DAO having become inoperable, inaccessible or unusable, including as the result of any code library or repository incorporated by reference into the POKT DAO or any other smart contract or oracle program on which the POKT DAO depends for any of the Legislature, Judiciary, or Executive functions, having become inoperable, inaccessible or unusable or having itself suffered a MAEE, mutatis mutandis;

  * a material and adverse effect on the use, functionality or performance of the POKT DAO as the result of any bug, defect or error in the POKT DAO or the triggering, use or exploitation (whether intentional or unintentional) thereof (it being understood that for purposes of this clause, a bug, defect or error will be deemed material only if it results in the unauthorized use of accounts within the Legislature, Judiciary, or Executive functions (which therefore have power over Governance Transactions), or the unauthorized alteration of the permissions/powers (e.g. voting weights) of the aforementioned accounts);

  * any unauthorized use of an administrative function or privilege of the POKT DAO, including: (A) any use of any administrative credential, key, password, account or address by a Person who has misappropriated or gained unauthorized access to such administrative credential, key, password, account or address or (B) any unauthorized use of an administrative function or privilege by the permission holder or representative of the permission holder (including Foundation Directors and their proxies);

  * reasonable suspicion that any smart contract or oracle on which the POKT DAO depends, for any of the Legislature, Judiciary, or Executive functions, is incentive-compromised, evidenced by the presence of all of the following factors: the total value of assets securing that smart contract or oracle (e.g. stakes) being surpassed by the value of the POKT DAO's treasury or POKT Network’s market cap, an abnormal (and unreversed) change in the total value of assets (or ownership distribution of assets) of that smart contract or oracle, and the submission of a proposal that alters the Constitution or the POKT Protocol’s consensus rules;

  * the POKT DAO or the Foundation (as the POKT DAO's executor) being subject to a Legal Order that prohibits the POKT DAO (or that, if the POKT DAO were a Person, would prohibit the POKT DAO) from executing any function or operation it would otherwise reasonably be expected to execute; or

  * any other unforeseen events resulting in unauthorized or unintended alterations to the checks and balances outlined in this Constitution.

13.4 If any User becomes aware that there is a MAEE, such User (the "Sending Party") shall deliver to the Foundation a notice (an "Exception Notice") signed by such User:

  * Certifying that the Sending Party believes in good faith that there is a MAEE;

  * Describing in reasonable detail the events, facts, circumstances and reasons forming the basis of such belief;

  * Containing a representation by the Sending Party, made to and for the benefit of the Foundation with the understanding that the Foundation will rely thereon, that, to the Sending Party’s knowledge, the certification and statements made pursuant to the preceding clauses are accurate as of the date of the Exception Notice, and, considered collectively, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

13.5 If the Foundation disputes the existence of a MAEE, then the Foundation shall promptly deliver a written notice of such non-acceptance, an "Exception Response Notice", to the Sending Party. The Exception Response Notice shall include the same categories of information, statements, evidence and representations and warranties as would be required for an Exception Notice, mutatis mutandis. The Sending Party may then lodge a complaint against the Foundation to the Cayman Island Summary Court. The decision resulting from the following court proceedings shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Foundation and the Users of POKT Network.

13.6 If the Foundation agrees with the contents of the Exception Notice, and unless the MAEE is deemed to bear no risk to the POKT DAO’s treasury tokens, upon receiving an Exception Notice, the Foundation shall deposit the POKT DAO's treasury tokens into a multi-signature account owned by all of the Directors of the Foundation, to be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, as a custodial trust held for the benefit of the POKT DAO, until the POKT DAO enters into an Exception Handling Addendum.

13.7 After depositing the tokens into the trust, the Foundation must then within 14 days publish a planned response to the MAEE (an "Exception Handling Proposal"):

  * Describing in reasonable detail a proposal by the Foundation of the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought by the Users involved;

  * Including copies of any written evidence or other material written information, and summaries of any other evidence, relevant to, and material for the consideration of, the MAEE and the other matters referred to in the Exception Notice.

13.8 If the Foundation fears that details of the MAEE may be exploited and cause further harm to Users, they may do any of the following:

  * Publish their Exception Handling Proposal to a private channel containing only Voters;

  * Publish an Exception Handling Proposal that excludes exploitable details, to be followed by publication of such details only when the fix is ready to be deployed;

  * Secretly deploy fixes to the MAEE, only if such fixes do not amend the POKT Protocol’s consensus rules or undermine practical adherence to this Constitution, and under the understanding that such fixes may be replaced by the POKT DAO once the MAEE has been resolved.

13.9 The term "Exception Handling Addendum" refers to an addendum to this Constitution setting forth the agreement on the existence or non-existence of a MAEE and the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto. An Exception Handling Proposal shall become an Exception Handling Addendum once a simple majority (50%) of pre-crisis Voters (whose voting power was claimed prior to the submission of the Exception Notice) has signaled approval of the Proposal. Each Exception Handling Addendum shall automatically and without further action of the POKT DAO or Foundation be deemed incorporated into and to form a part of this Constitution.

13.10 Once the Foundation has executed on the Addendum and the MAEE is resolved, if the Foundation deposited the POKT DAO's treasury tokens into a multi-signature account following 13.7, the Foundation shall return all tokens in the custodial trust to a protocol-owned DAO account. If the Foundation neglects to return the tokens within 14 days, any member of the POKT DAO may lodge a complaint against the Foundation to the Cayman Island Summary Court. The decision resulting from the following court proceedings shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Foundation and the Users of POKT Network.

13.11 If the POKT DAO disputes the existence of a MAEE, or does not wish to accept all or any part of the Foundation's Exception Handling Proposal, then the POKT DAO may simply reject the proposal. If after 14 days less than 50% of the POKT DAO have signaled support of the Proposal, and the Foundation refuses to return the POKT DAO's tokens to the original account, any member of the POKT DAO may lodge a complaint against the Foundation to the Cayman Island Summary Court. The decision resulting from the following court proceedings shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Foundation and the Users of POKT Network.


## 14. Liability

14.1 Users shall be liable for losses caused by false or misleading attestations, such as fraudulent relay proofs, and shall forfeit any stake thereby according to the consensus rules of the POKT Protocol.

14.2 Because the Foundation defers to the POKT DAO, the POKT DAO is ultimately responsible for reviewing new software and approving Protocol Upgrades. Further, the Validator Nodes are responsible for accepting Protocol Upgrade Governance Transactions approved by the POKT DAO, and Users consent to the Validator Nodes decisions through their use of the blockchain per 11.1. Therefore, the Users agree to hold software developers harmless for unintentional mistakes made in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.


## 15. Finances

15.1 Contributors agree to pay taxes on all POKT DAO-related income in whichever jurisdiction they reside. The POKT DAO will not be held liable for any neglect in this matter.

15.2 It is forbidden to propose or approve unconditional general distributions of the POKT DAO Treasury to token holders, which may be misconstrued as dividends.

15.3 The Foundation may on the POKT DAO's behalf exchange POKT for another cryptocurrency or token for the purpose of using external blockchains.
